### Lagrangian:
    The lagrangian is one of the ways to calculate the equations of motions in physics as an alternative to $f = m \times a$. The lagrangian is defined as $l = k - p$ where k is kinetic energy and p is potential energy. To find the equations of motion the length of the lagrangian is then evaluated by intergrating it, which converts it into a functional, a function that takes in another function and spits out a number, and then by finding the function that makes the derivative of the functional zero.
example:
$$ int_{\alpha}^{\beta} l\,dx$$
